# MOVIE DATA ANALYSIS

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to "Movie Data Analysis," a project delving into a comprehensive dataset with 8,790 rows of movie information. In this endeavor, we set out on an engaging journey to uncover hidden narratives within this extensive dataset, employing Python as our primary tool. Our key objectives encompass meticulous data cleaning and the use of visualization tools such as Seaborn or Matplotlib. Through this process, our aim is to unveil patterns, trends, and intriguing insights within the vast world of movie. Join us in this exploration, where the precision of Python-based data cleaning and the creativity of visualization converge to reveal the narratives embedded within 8,790 rows of movie information. The focus is on ensuring data accuracy and clarity in visual representations, offering detailed insights by addressing questions related to the most popular director, movie production trends, top and bottom movie-producing countries, and more. Let's dive into the world of movies and uncover the compelling stories behind the data!

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Scrutinize column names and data types for standardization.
   - Extract the year and month from the date column to facilitate visualization.
   - Calculate the number of days from a movie's release date to the current date for temporal context.
     
2. Identify the most popular director
3. Determine the top 5 and bottom 5 countries in terms of movie production.
4. Analyze and visualize trends in movie production over different years.
5. Uncover the most popular country-genre mix
6. Calculate and visualize countries with the highest average movie duration.

By addressing these challenges, this project aims to enrich the exploration of movie data, offering valuable insights through a combination of precise data cleaning and informative visualizations.
