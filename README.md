## STAGES TO NAVIGATE IN THE MOVIE DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

The project comprises four critical stages essential for successful completion, which encompass:
1. Libraries and Data Importation
2. Data Assessment
3. Data Cleaning
4. Data Manipulation and Data Visualization

#### EXPLANATIONS

1. Libraries and Data Importation:
 ---
 The initial step of this project involves importing essential libraries suitable for the tasks. In this instance, I imported the following libraries: pandas, which is commonly aliased as 'pd' for data importation and manipulation; datetime, aliased as 'dt' to handle date data types; matplotlib.pyplot, aliased as 'plt' for data visualization; and the warnings library to handle any potential warnings encountered during the project.
 
 Once these libraries are imported, the subsequent step is to bring the movie dataset into the Jupyter environment as a DataFrame using the 'pd.read_csv()' function. The dataset is then assigned to a variable named 'df'. Consequently, whenever 'df' is referenced, the movie dataset appears.
 
 Below is the code snippet that accomplishes this task:
 ```python
import pandas as pd
import datetime as dt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\HP\Downloads\Python Dataset\Python Project Dataset.csv')
df
```
The output generated by running this code is displayed in the snapshot below. It is essential to note that the ellipsis (...) present in the data importation output after number 4 indicates the existence of additional rows of information that are not fully displayed unless additional lines of code are used.

2. Data Assessment:
--- 
Data assessment is the fundamental process of evaluating imported data to determine its suitability and cleanliness for its intended purpose. There are two primary methods of data assessment: virtual assessment and programmatic assessment. In this case, programmatic assessment was utilized, which involves assessing data using codes, especially when dealing with datasets containing numerous rows and columns that cannot be feasibly examined manually.

Several attributes and functions provided by the pandas library were employed for data assessment, including:

- df.shape attribute: Provides the dimensions of the DataFrame (number of rows and columns).
- df.info() function: Displays a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the data types and memory usage.
- df.isnull().sum() function: Counts the number of missing values in each column.
- df.duplicated().sum() function: Counts the number of duplicate rows in the DataFrame.
- df[column_name].value_counts() function: Returns the frequency count of unique values in a specific column.
  
These assessments are illustrated in the snapshots below. The issues detected during the assessment process are outlined in snapshot "D".

3. Data Cleaning:
---
Upon assessment, various data issues were detected, including:
- Inconsistent column headers and Non-descriptive column labeling
- Inconsistent labeling of column values
- Incorrect data type for the 'Date' column.

  It is crucial to address these issues to prevent the possibility of drawing misleading conclusions during data analysis.

  To tackle **Inconsistent column headers and Non-descriptive column labeling**, we opted to rename the columns using a dictionary. This dictionary stored the initial column names and their corresponding new names. The dictionary was assigned to a variable called "Col" for easy reference. We utilized the pandas rename function, specifying the columns keyword argument as "Col" to apply the dictionary changes, and set the inplace keyword argument to true to implement the changes in the main dataset.

  For addressing **Inconsistent labeling of column values**, we utilized the pandas replace function. This function allows us to specify old values and their corresponding new values, along with the inplace keyword argument to apply changes directly to the dataset. Columns such as genre, title, country, rating, duration, and ID underwent this transformation, although only the cleaning process for the genre and title columns will be demonstrated in the snapshot below to showcase how inconsistent labeling of column values can be rectified.

  Lastly, to address the **Incorrect data type for the 'Date' column**, we employed the datetime function. Prior to this, we encountered a problem within the date column where opening and closing brackets '()' were found within dates. To resolve this issue, we initially used the startswith string function to identify dates starting with these brackets. We then applied the strip function to remove the brackets and subsequently utilized the pandas datetime function to convert the date column from text data type to date data type. The dayfirst keyword argument of the datetime function was set to true to specify the format of the date.
